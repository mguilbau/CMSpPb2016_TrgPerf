\section{Parton distribution functions in nuclei}

High energy pPb collisions at the LHC provide unique opportunities
to explore modifications of parton distribution functions
in nuclei (nPDF) over an unprecedented Bjorken-$x$ and 
virtuality $Q^{2}$ coverages. These studies may provide
answers to some of the very important questions like: Is nPDF universal? 
Is QCD factorization applicable in pA collisions?
In CMS, a variety of hard probes, such 
as dijets of both light and heavy flavor, $D$ and $B$ mesons, and
top quarks, are utilized to study nPDF in pPb collisions with 
great precision. Perspectives of these hard probe measurements 
in the 2016 pPb run are discussed in this section.
