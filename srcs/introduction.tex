\section*{Introduction}

pPb run with integrated luminosity of 35 nb$^{-1}$ has been collected.
nuclear parton distribution function (nPDF)

It has been decided in 2016 that the heavy ion run will be splitted between 5 and 8 TeV.

\begin{itemize}
\item Is a QGP fluid formed in pPb collisions?
\item Explore nPDF over unexplored regime in x and Q.
\end{itemize}

We need integrated luminosity as high as possible. 
We use 100 nb$^{-1}$ as a demonstration.
