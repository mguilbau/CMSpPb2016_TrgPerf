\subsection{D and B mesons}
A high statistics sample of pPb collisions will be extremely useful to test heavy-flavour production over a wide transverse momentum range.
At low $\rm p_{T}$, the study of the nuclear modification factors of D and B mesons allows to test the relevance of cold nuclear matter effects in the 
heavy flavour sector~\cite{Eskola:2009uj,deFlorian:2003qf,Frankfurt:2011cs}. Gluon saturation processes are expected to reduce the production 
cross sections of D mesons of about 10-20$\%$ at about 2-3 GeV/c.  
In the B sector, a smaller modification is expected as a consequence of the large $x$ range that we investigate with this measurement.
A precise measurement of the D and B nuclear modification factors in pPb collisions at low $\rm p_{T}$ is therefore needed to experimentally validate
the theoretical expectations.
In Fig~\ref{fig:measurementB}, the current measurement performed at 5.02 TeV with  $\rm L_{int}$=34.8/nb is presented~\cite{PhysRevLett.116.032301}. The current statistical 
and systematic uncertanties do not allow to appreciate any significant deviation from unity. In Fig~\ref{fig:Bextrapolated}, the result expected at 8 TeV
considering an integrated luminosity of 100/nb is presented. In order to have the possibility to measure the B production down to low $\rm p_{T}$ with the needed accuracy (~5-10$\%$), 
the largest luminosity available is therefore strictly necessary.  A larger sample of 8 TeV pPb data would also be beneficial for heavy flavour studies at high $\rm p_{T}$.  In Fig~\ref{fig:plotsDBpredictions}, 
the FONLL predictions for D (left) and B (right) cross sections are shown. A  increase of the heavy-flavour cross section of about 2 is
expected at $\rm p_{T}~$100 GeV/c as a consequence of the larger centre-of-mass value.
